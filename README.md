# Academia

A list of public papers, articles, essays and dissertations that I'm interested in

## What is this

As you can guess this is kind of my personal reading list, it contains a list of documents from various sources in branches and scope of computer science that I might be interested in.

Is structured as a Git repository for two main reasons:

- Its always available and public even if I'm not authenticated with my accounts
- People who shares my interest can contribute and send me more resource to study from

I found most of these documents from other repositories of papers such as [papers-we-love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) or specific site such as the [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/research) one.

## ToDo list

A list of "sources" to be researched in future, again feel free to contribute.

- [Deepmind](https://www.deepmind.com/research) Research Portal
- [papers-we-love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love) I'm interested in, let me know if you have something interesting about it.

Another list but for arguments and topics I.

- Virtual Machines
- Distributed Systems and Filesystems
- Blockchain, especially about Smart Contract's language & VM or Consensus algorithm
- Compiler construction
- Language design and programming languages
- Concurrency and algorithm
- Static & Dynamic analysis
